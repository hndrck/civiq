## The Challenge

The Government of Yukon faced significant challenges with fragmented emergency communications across multiple platforms. Citizens had to navigate separate websites for wildfire information, flood alerts, road conditions, and general emergency updates, creating confusion during critical situations.

With 40% of Yukon communities having low connectivity and increasing frequency of multi-hazard events, the territory needed evidence-based insights to guide their emergency communications strategy for 45,000 residents spread across vast, remote areas.

## The Approach

Civiq Design conducted a comprehensive jurisdictional scan examining emergency communication approaches across five Canadian jurisdictions: British Columbia, Alberta, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Northwest Territories.

**Research Methodology:**
- Stakeholder interviews with emergency management officials and technical leads
- Desk research analyzing public platforms, policies, and emergency response systems
- Comparative analysis using a structured framework across four key areas:
  - Communication platforms and integration approaches
  - Public notification systems and accessibility
  - Mapping and visualization tools
  - Multi-hazard coordination models

The research was conducted in close collaboration with Yukon's Emergency Management Office, Geomatics team, and Communications branch to ensure findings addressed their specific context and constraints.

## The Outcome

The project delivered a comprehensive research report with strategic and technical recommendations for integrating Yukon's emergency communication systems while maintaining accessibility for remote communities.

**Key Deliverables:**
- **Jurisdictional comparison table** — analyzing approaches across all Canadian provinces and territories
- **Evidence-based recommendations** — organized into strategic priorities and technical solutions
- **Implementation roadmap** — providing clear next steps for digital transformation
- **Cross-jurisdictional insights** — on multi-channel strategies and governance frameworks

The final report was published on [Yukon's Open Government platform](https://open.yukon.ca/information/publications/jurisdictional-scan-public-emergency-communications), making it a shared resource for emergency management professionals across Canada.

The research established a foundation for Yukon's ongoing efforts to create a unified emergency information hub and has been referenced by other Canadian jurisdictions facing similar rural and remote communication challenges.
